Why we do not insert setup object and non-setup objects in same transaction, why salesforce put this limit ?

Setup Objects =>	User, Profile, PermissionSetAssignment, QueueSObject, etc.	Metadata/configuration level objects — they define how Salesforce is set up, not business data.
Non-Setup Objects =>	Account, Contact, Opportunity, Custom__c, etc.	Business data — records that users work with in the app.
